# ARCHITECTURE.md

Version: 1.1
Status: Finalized (Sprint 3); Backend Integration Locked (Sprint 4)
Governs: Sprint 5 onward

# PURPOSE

This document finalizes the software architecture introduced in
MASTER_SPECIFICATION.md by mapping its Application Layers to the
concrete structure already implemented, and by locking in the
architectural decisions needed before backend and AI work begins.

MASTER_SPECIFICATION.md remains the top-level authority. This document
does not override it — it makes it concrete and actionable.

# LAYER MAPPING

## Presentation Layer

Location: `frontend/src`

- `components/layout/` — shell chrome (title bar, sidebar, status bar,
  window controls). Owns no business logic.
- `components/explorer/` — Project Explorer view.
- `components/logger/` — Logger Panel view.
- `components/dashboard/` — Dashboard view.
- `components/settings/` — Settings modal.
- `components/common/` — shared, reusable, presentation-only primitives
  (e.g. `IconButton`). A component belongs here only if it has no
  feature-specific knowledge.
- `theme/` — Theme Manager (React Context + provider + hook), the only
  cross-cutting frontend state so far.

Rule: components read data through props or hooks only. No component
may import Node/Python/filesystem APIs directly — that always goes
through `window.nemi` (see IPC Boundary below).

## Application Layer

Not yet implemented. Reserved for:

- Controllers that translate UI intent (e.g. "open project") into
  calls against services.
- Services that orchestrate filesystem, database, and AI operations.
- Workflow coordination between AI agents (Planner → Developer →
  Reviewer → Tester, per `agents/*.md`).

This layer must live outside `components/` (e.g. a future
`frontend/src/app` or, once the Python process is wired in,
partially in `backend/app`). It must never be implemented as logic
embedded inside a React component.

## AI Layer

Not yet implemented. Reserved for provider adapters (Claude, OpenAI,
Gemini, DeepSeek, Qwen, Ollama per TECH_STACK.md), the memory system
(see MASTER_SPECIFICATION.md → MEMORY SYSTEM), and the agent
implementations that operationalize `agents/*.md`.

Locked in Sprint 4: AI provider calls will be made from the Python
backend, never proxied through or exposed to the renderer. This
follows directly from the Security Rules ("never expose secrets", "no
secrets inside source code") and from the transport decision below —
the backend is already the sole owner of anything that talks to the
outside world.

## Data Layer

- `backend/app` — Python backend package. As of Sprint 4 this is a
  running FastAPI service, not just a scaffold (see BACKEND SERVICE
  below).
- SQLite — see `docs/DATABASE_SCHEMA.md` for the finalized table
  design. As of Sprint 4 the schema is created automatically at
  backend startup (`app/db/schema.py::init_db`) into
  `database/nemi.db`. Only the `logs` table has a repository
  (`app/db/repositories/logs_repository.py`) so far — the other seven
  tables are schema-ready but have no repository/business logic yet,
  intentionally deferred to the sprints that need them.
- `logs/` — now actively used: the backend's rotating file log lives
  at `logs/backend.log` (see LOGGING below). `memory/`, `config/`,
  `projects/` remain reserved per MASTER_SPECIFICATION's FOLDER
  STRUCTURE, not yet wired to any process.
- `database/*.db` and `logs/*.log` are gitignored — both are runtime
  artifacts regenerated on backend startup, never committed.

# ELECTRON PROCESS MODEL

Three processes, already implemented and hardened in Sprint 2:

- **Main process** (`frontend/electron/main.ts`) — owns the
  `BrowserWindow`, window controls, and (in the future) spawning the
  Python backend as a child process. `sandbox: true`,
  `contextIsolation: true`, `nodeIntegration: false`.
- **Preload script** (`frontend/electron/preload.ts`) — the only
  bridge between main and renderer. Exposes a typed `window.nemi`
  surface via `contextBridge`. Nothing beyond what the renderer
  actually needs may be exposed here.
- **Renderer process** (`frontend/src`) — the React app. Never talks
  to Node.js, the filesystem, or Python directly.

## IPC Boundary (locked decision)

All renderer → native calls go through `window.nemi`
(declared in `frontend/src/types/electron-api.d.ts`). As of Sprint 4
this surface has two namespaces: `windowControls` (Sprint 2) and
`backend` (Sprint 4, currently just `health()`). Future filesystem,
database, or AI-agent triggers must be added here first, as a typed
method, before any component may call them. A component must never
assume Node.js globals exist.

The renderer never talks to the backend HTTP API directly — it has no
network access to it, and the CSP's `connect-src 'self'` intentionally
does not allow it. Every backend call is relayed through Electron
main via `ipcMain.handle(...)` / `ipcRenderer.invoke(...)`, which then
performs the HTTP request to `127.0.0.1` from the Node context. This
keeps the renderer's attack surface unchanged from Sprint 2's
hardening baseline even though a live local service now exists.

# STATE MANAGEMENT PATTERN (locked decision)

No external state library. The established pattern (from
`theme/ThemeProvider.tsx`) is:

1. A `createContext` module exporting the context + its value type.
2. A `Provider` component owning `useState`/`useEffect` and
   persistence (e.g. `localStorage`).
3. A `useX()` hook that reads the context and throws if used outside
   its provider.

Any new cross-cutting frontend state (e.g. a future Project context,
Agent Session context) must follow this exact three-file pattern for
consistency. Local, component-only state stays as plain `useState` —
do not lift state into Context unless it is genuinely shared across
unrelated components.

# BACKEND SERVICE (locked decision — Sprint 4)

**Framework**: FastAPI + Uvicorn. Chosen over a minimal stdlib
approach because it gives structured request/response handling,
built-in validation, a natural home for a `/health` endpoint, and a
straightforward path to streaming (SSE) responses once AI provider
calls are added — all without hand-rolling an HTTP layer. This is the
first runtime dependency the backend has ever had (Sprint 1B was
intentionally dependency-free); `fastapi`/`uvicorn` are now in
`backend/requirements.txt`.

**Transport**: plain HTTP over `127.0.0.1`, fixed port `8756`
(overridable via `NEMI_BACKEND_HOST` / `NEMI_BACKEND_PORT`). A fixed
port was chosen over OS-assigned ephemeral-port negotiation for
simplicity and debuggability (`curl http://127.0.0.1:8756/health`
always works in dev) — this project runs one backend instance per
running app instance, so port collision risk is low. Ephemeral-port
negotiation (child prints its bound port on stdout, main parses it)
is a documented future option if multi-instance support is ever
needed.

**Process lifecycle**: Electron main owns the backend's entire
lifecycle (`frontend/electron/backend-process.ts`):

- Spawned via `python -m app.main` with `cwd` set to `backend/`,
  started right after `app.whenReady()` — in parallel with window
  creation, not blocking it.
- Readiness is polled via `GET /health` (300ms interval, 15s
  timeout) from Electron main; state is one of `starting` / `ready`
  / `error` / `stopped`, exposed to the renderer via
  `window.nemi.backend.health()`.
- Stopped via `child.kill()` on `app.on('before-quit')`. Verified
  manually in Sprint 4 that a graceful window close terminates the
  Python child — no orphaned process.
- stdout/stderr are piped to Electron's console today (prefixed
  `[backend]`). Relaying them into the in-app Logger Panel is future
  work — the Logger Panel is still mock data (Sprint 2 pending item).

**Known limitation**: spawning `python` from `PATH` assumes a
compatible Python + the backend's dependencies are installed on the
machine running the app. This is acceptable for development; a
packaged/distributed build will need to bundle a Python runtime
(e.g. PyInstaller) — tracked as a pending task, not solved this
sprint (packaging is explicitly a later MASTER_SPECIFICATION phase).

# PLUGIN / EXTENSION ARCHITECTURE (future — not started)

MASTER_SPECIFICATION.md lists "Plugin Marketplace" under FUTURE
MODULES. No plugin loader, manifest format, or sandboxing model
exists yet. Any future plugin system must not weaken the current
Electron hardening (sandbox, contextIsolation, CSP) — plugin code
must never run with Node.js integration in the renderer.

---

# SUMMARY OF LOCKED DECISIONS

1. The Application layer (controllers/services/workflow orchestration)
   is a reserved namespace, not yet implemented.
2. All native access from the renderer goes through
   `window.nemi` — no exceptions. The renderer has no direct network
   access to the backend; Electron main relays every call.
3. AI provider secrets belong in the Python backend, never the
   renderer, once the AI layer exists (Sprint 4: locked, not yet built).
4. Cross-cutting frontend state follows the Context+Provider+Hook
   three-file pattern established by the Theme Manager.
5. **(Sprint 4)** Backend framework is FastAPI + Uvicorn, transport is
   HTTP over `127.0.0.1:8756` (fixed port), Electron main owns the
   Python child process's full lifecycle (spawn, health-poll, kill).
6. **(Sprint 4)** SQLite schema is created automatically at backend
   startup into `database/nemi.db`; only the `logs` table has a
   repository so far — remaining tables are schema-ready, awaiting
   the business logic that needs them.
7. **(Sprint 4)** Centralized logging is console + rotating file
   (`logs/backend.log`) via the stdlib `logging` module, separate
   from the structured `logs` SQLite table (which holds discrete
   lifecycle/audit entries for the future Logger Panel, not a mirror
   of every log line).
8. **(Sprint 4)** Backend errors return a consistent
   `{"error": {"code", "message"}}` JSON shape via global FastAPI
   exception handlers; unhandled exceptions are logged with full
   traceback server-side and never leak internals to the client.
